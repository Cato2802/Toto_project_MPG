# Toto_project_MPG
 I analyzed car fuel efficiency (MPG) using Python and StatsModels. I performed linear regression on a dataset containing various car attributes, such as horsepower, displacement, weight, acceleration, and origin. I visualized the relationships between MPG and predictor variables through scatter plots and regression lines.
